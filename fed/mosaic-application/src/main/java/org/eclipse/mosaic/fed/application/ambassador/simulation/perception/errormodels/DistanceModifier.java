/**
 * This implementation of {@link PerceptionModifier} is a stochastic filter, that works on the
 * principle that closer vehicles are more likely to be perceived than further vehicles.
 * This is done by giving perceived objects ratings relating to the distance of the ego vehicle.
 * We give the closest vehicle the best rating (0) and the furthest vehicle the worst (1).
 * Additionally, we use square distances for comparisons based on the inverse-square law,
 * giving closer vehicles proportionally better scores.
 * This modifier can also be configured using {@link #offset}, which allows adjusting the
 * stochastic component to allow for more or less perceptions.
